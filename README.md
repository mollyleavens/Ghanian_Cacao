Survey analysis of Ghanian Cacao farmers


Topic


This app summarizes some of the key variables for a survey of several thousand cacao farmers across Ghana in both 2008 and 2014. Harvard Professor Micheal Hiscox and Mondelez, the world’s largest chocolate company, jointly implemented this survey but I am the first researcher to ever work with the data. This 73-page survey collected the farmer’s basic demographic data as well as hundreds of metrics assessing their economic livelihood, education, access to resources, and agronomic and environmental practices. 

This app does not contain statistical analyses and is not meant to claim correlations, causations, or significance. It is rather to display the framework for the survey and some key aggregated data.


Motivation

Ghana is the world’s second largest cacao producing region after its neighbor the Ivory Coast. The social, economic, and environmental conditions of these farmers is therefore critical in assessing effective intervention methods and predicting future global cacao market trends.
